                        #DNS request

1. -User's PC DNS Resolver:-

   - When the user enters the URL in their browser, the first step is the DNS resolution process. The browser first checks its local cache to see if it already knows the IP address associated with the domain "www.google.com." This cache could have been populated from previous visits to the same site, saving time in the resolution process.
   - If the IP address is not found in the cache, the browser sends a DNS resolution request to the user's PC DNS resolver.

2. -Local DNS Resolver:-

   - The user's PC DNS resolver is typically provided by the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or configured manually. This resolver maintains its own cache. It first checks its cache to see if it has the IP address for "www.google.com."
   - If the resolver doesn't have the information, it will forward the request to the root name servers.

3. -Root Name Servers:-

   - The root name servers are a crucial part of the DNS hierarchy. There are 13 sets of root name servers distributed globally. These servers contain information about the Top-Level Domains (TLDs) and their associated authoritative name servers.
   - The local DNS resolver sends a request to one of the root name servers, asking for the IP address associated with "www.google.com."

4. -TLD Servers:-

   - The root name server responds to the local DNS resolver with information about the Top-Level Domain (TLD) for ".com." The TLD servers maintain information about the authoritative name servers for each domain within that TLD.
   - The local DNS resolver now queries the TLD servers for ".com" to find the authoritative name servers for "www.google.com."

5. -Authoritative Name Servers:-

   - The TLD servers respond with the IP addresses of the authoritative name servers for "google.com." These are servers specifically responsible for knowing the IP addresses associated with the domain.
   - The local DNS resolver sends a final query to one of the authoritative name servers for "google.com," asking for the IP address of "www.google.com."

6. -IP Address Resolution:-

   - The authoritative name server responds to the local DNS resolver with the IP address of "www.google.com."
   - The resolver then stores this information in its cache for future use and sends the IP address to the user's browser.

7. -Establishing Connection:-

   - Now armed with the IP address, the browser can establish a connection to the web server hosting "www.google.com" using the HTTPS protocol (secure version of HTTP).

8. -Loading the Website:-
   - With the established connection, the browser sends an HTTP GET request to the web server. The server responds by sending the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to the browser, which renders the webpage.

## In summary, the process involves a series of DNS queries starting from the user's PC DNS resolver, progressing through the root name servers, TLD servers, and finally reaching the authoritative name servers to obtain the IP address necessary to establish a connection with the desired website.

                               #TCP/IP

Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP): An Advanced Explanation

1.  Overview:
    TCP/IP, short for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, represents a fundamental suite of protocols
    that form the backbone of modern computer networking. It provides the framework for communication
    between devices on a network, enabling the exchange of data across diverse and interconnected systems.
    TCP/IP is not a single protocol but rather a suite of protocols, each serving a specific purpose in the communication process.

    TCP/IP request handles a user entering "https://www.google.com" in a browser and pressing Enter. This involves multiple steps, and the data is segmented into packets as it traverses the TCP/IP protocol stack:

1.  URL Parsing (Browser):
    The user types "https://www.google.com" and hits Enter.
    The browser parses the URL, extracting the protocol (HTTPS) and the domain name ("www.google.com").
1.  DNS Resolution (Application Layer - HTTP):
    The browser initiates a DNS request to resolve "www.google.com" into an IP address.
    This request is part of the Application Layer (Layer 7) and uses the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.
1.  TCP/IP Stack Initialization (Transport Layer - TCP):
    Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a TCP connection to the IP address.
    TCP is part of the Transport Layer (Layer 4) and is responsible for ensuring reliable data delivery.
1.  TCP Three-Way Handshake:
    Segment 1 (SYN): The browser sends a SYN packet to the server, requesting a connection.
    Segment 2 (SYN-ACK): The server responds with a SYN-ACK, acknowledging the request and signaling readiness.
    Segment 3 (ACK): The browser sends an ACK, confirming the establishment of the connection.
1.  Secure Connection Setup (Presentation Layer - SSL/TLS):
    If the protocol is HTTPS, the browser and server engage in a secure handshake using SSL/TLS.
    This occurs at the Presentation Layer (Layer 6), ensuring encrypted communication.
1.  HTTP Request (Application Layer - HTTP):
    The browser sends an HTTP request for the resource ("/" in this case) to the server.
    This request is part of the Application Layer (Layer 7) and uses the HTTP protocol.
1.  Data Segmentation (Transport Layer - TCP):
    The data is segmented into smaller units called TCP segments for transmission.
    Each segment has a sequence number for proper ordering during reassembly.
1.  TCP Packet Encapsulation (Network Layer - IP):
    Each TCP segment is encapsulated into an IP packet for routing.
    The IP header contains source and destination IP addresses.
1.  Routing (Network Layer - IP):
    IP routers make decisions on the best path to reach the destination IP address.
    IP packets are forwarded through intermediate routers towards Google's server.
1.  Data Link Layer (Link Layer):
    IP packets are encapsulated into frames suitable for the physical network medium (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.) at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2).
1.  Physical Layer:
    The framed data is transmitted over the physical network medium to reach Google's server.
1.  Server Processing (Transport Layer - TCP and Application Layer - HTTP):
    The server receives the TCP segments, extracts the HTTP request, and processes it.
1.  HTTP Response (Application Layer - HTTP):
    The server generates an HTTP response containing the requested data.
1.  Data Segmentation (Transport Layer - TCP):
    The response data is segmented into TCP segments for transmission.
1.  TCP Packet Encapsulation (Network Layer - IP):
    Each TCP segment is encapsulated into an IP packet for routing back to the client.
1.  Data Link Layer (Link Layer):
    IP packets are encapsulated into frames at the Data Link Layer for transmission back to the client.
1.  Physical Layer:
    The framed data is transmitted over the physical network medium back to the client.
1.  Browser Processing (Transport Layer - TCP and Application Layer - HTTP):
    The browser receives the TCP segments, extracts the HTTP response, and processes it.
    The web page is rendered, completing the user's request.
    In summary, the TCP/IP protocol stack divides the user's request into manageable segments, encapsulates them with relevant information at each layer, and ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data between the client and server. The process involves various layers, protocols, and mechanisms to enable seamless communication over a network.

                                      #Firewall

    A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Its primary role is to establish a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the internet. Firewalls can operate at both the client and server sides of a communication process, providing a crucial layer of defense against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and other potential security threats.

    In the context of requests like "https://www.google.com" at both the client and server sides:

    Client-Side Firewall:

    On the client side, the firewall monitors outgoing traffic from the user's computer to the internet.
    When the user enters "https://www.google.com" in the browser and presses Enter, the client-side firewall examines the outgoing connection request.
    It checks if the destination (www.google.com), the protocol (HTTPS), and other parameters comply with the security policies defined by the firewall.
    The firewall may allow or block the outgoing connection based on its configured rules. If the connection is allowed, the client can proceed to establish a secure connection with the server.
    Server-Side Firewall:

    On the server side, the firewall monitors incoming traffic directed at the server.
    When a user sends an HTTP request to "https://www.google.com," the server-side firewall examines the incoming connection request.
    It checks if the request complies with security policies, looking at parameters such as the source of the request, the requested resource, and the protocol used.
    The firewall may allow or block the incoming connection based on its configured rules. If the connection is allowed, the server processes the request and sends back the appropriate HTTP response.
    In summary, a firewall acts as a gatekeeper for both client and server sides of a network communication. It enforces security policies, filters network traffic, and protects against unauthorized access or potential threats. On the client side, it ensures that outgoing requests meet security criteria, while on the server side, it guards against potentially harmful incoming traffic. In the case of "https://www.google.com," the firewall helps ensure a secure and controlled exchange of data between the user's device and Google's servers.

                                   #HTTPS/SSL

1.  **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
    HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It is an application layer protocol that facilitates the transfer of hypertext, typically in the form of HTML documents. In a standard HTTP connection, data is transmitted in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception or manipulation by malicious actors. This lack of security is particularly concerning when sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data, is being transmitted.

1.  **HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
    HTTPS is an extension of HTTP designed to provide a secure and encrypted communication channel over a computer network, typically the internet. The "S" in HTTPS stands for "Secure," and it uses a combination of HTTP and a security protocol, usually SSL/TLS, to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between a user's browser and the website's server
1.  **SSL** (Secure Sockets Layer) / **TLS** (Transport Layer Security):
    SSL and its successor, TLS, are cryptographic protocols that operate at the transport layer of the internet protocol suite. Their primary purpose is to secure communication over a network, such as the internet. These protocols use a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption to achieve data confidentiality and integrity.

When a user types "https://www.google.com" into a browser and presses Enter, several steps are involved in establishing a secure connection through HTTPS:

1.  **DNS Resolution:**

    - The browser first performs a Domain Name System (DNS) resolution to find the IP address associated with "www.google.com."

2.  **TCP Handshake:**

    - Once the IP address is obtained, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server at that IP address.

3.  **SSL/TLS Handshake:**

    - The browser, upon connecting to the server, initiates the SSL/TLS handshake process to establish a secure communication channel.

4.  **SSL/TLS Certificate Exchange:**

    - During the handshake, the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate to the browser. This certificate contains the server's public key, information about the certificate authority that issued it, and the server's digital signature.

5.  **Public Key Encryption:**

    - Your browser uses the server's public key to encrypt a symmetric key (session key) and sends it back to the server. This ensures that even if someone intercepts the communication, they cannot easily decrypt the data without the private key.

6.  **Private Key Decryption:**

    - The server, using its private key, decrypts the symmetric key received from the browser. Now, both the client and server have a shared session key.

7.  **Secure Communication:**

    - The subsequent communication between the browser and the server is encrypted using the shared session key. This ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged during the session.

8.  **Data Exchange:**

    - With the secure connection established, your browser and the server can exchange data securely, preventing eavesdropping or tampering.

    Regarding the previous example with Amazon, the SSL/TLS handshake process involves the exchange of certificates and public keys, similar to what happens when connecting to Google. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption. The session key is shared securely between the client and server, ensuring that the communication remains confidential and protected from potential attackers.

    In summary, the use of SSL/TLS in the HTTPS protocol employs a combination of public and private key encryption to establish a secure connection, safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the user's browser and the server.
