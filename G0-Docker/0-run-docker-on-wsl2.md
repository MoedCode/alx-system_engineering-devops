Thought for 4 seconds


Since you’ve already got the Docker engine installed in your WSL2 Ubuntu, you can run it entirely from your WSL shell—no Windows Docker Desktop or systemd needed. Here’s the simplest way:

---

## 1. Launch the Docker daemon manually

In your **Ubuntu WSL2** terminal, start the daemon in the background:

```bash
sudo dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock \
             --storage-driver=vfs &> ~/dockerd.log &
```

* `--host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock` tells Docker to listen on the standard Unix socket.
* `--storage-driver=vfs` is the most compatible driver in WSL.
* `&> ~/dockerd.log &` runs it in the background and logs output to `~/dockerd.log`.

Give it a few seconds to initialize.

---

## 2. Verify it’s running

```bash
docker version
docker info
```

You should now see both **Client** and **Server** sections, confirming the daemon is up.

---

## 3. Test with a container

```bash
docker run --rm hello-world
```

You should see the “Hello from Docker!” message.

---

## 4. Automate startup (optional)

If you want Docker to start whenever you open your WSL shell, add this to the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
# Start dockerd if it's not already running
if ! pgrep -x dockerd >/dev/null; then
  sudo dockerd --host=unix:///var/run/docker.sock \
               --storage-driver=vfs &> ~/dockerd.log &
  sleep 3
fi
```

After adding, reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now every new shell session will auto-launch the Docker daemon for you.

---

That way you can **use Docker entirely within WSL2**, just like on a native Linux box—no Windows service, no systemd, no Docker Desktop required.
