The issue you experienced is related to the file path specified in the `-f` test within your script. Let's explore the difference between `-f ~/testfile` and `-f ./testfile`:

1. `-f ~/testfile`: This checks for the existence of a file named "testfile" in your home directory. The `~` character represents your home directory. So, if you execute the script from a location that is not your home directory, the script won't find the file because it's looking for "testfile" specifically in your home directory.

2. `-f ./testfile`: This checks for the existence of a file named "testfile" in the current working directory. The `./` represents the current directory. If you execute the script from the same directory where "testfile" is located, it will find the file.

In your case, when you use `-f ~/testfile`, the script is looking for "testfile" in your home directory, and it doesn't find it because "testfile" is in your current working directory. When you change it to `-f ./testfile`, it correctly checks for "testfile" in the current directory where the script is located.

So, the choice of `-f ./testfile` is correct when you want to check for the existence of "testfile" in the same directory where the script is executed.
